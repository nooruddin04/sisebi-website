  <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
  <p>
    At <strong>Sisebi</strong>, we provide trade intelligence reports and insights on a subscription basis. 
    Due to the digital nature of our services, we currently do not offer refunds or cancellations once a subscription or report is purchased.

  <p>
    We encourage users to review all details carefully before making a payment. 
    In case of any technical issues or billing errors, please reach out to our support team, 
    and we will assist you promptly.
