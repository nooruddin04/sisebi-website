      On one hand, India remains one of the world’s largest consumer markets — importing thousands of commodities every year.  
      On the other, rising global tariffs and supply chain shocks are forcing businesses everywhere to rethink sourcing and market strategies.  

      This opens up two big questions for India’s economy:  
      1. Which imports can we realistically substitute with domestic production?  
      2. Where do the best new export opportunities lie, given shifting global trade flows?  

      At SISEBI, we help you answer these with real trade data across 12,000+ commodities, backed by India’s last 8 years of import-export history.

      India’s import bill continues to rise sharply. For many sectors, we remain overly dependent on foreign supply chains.  

      Import substitution is not just about saving forex. It means:  
      • Stable domestic supply  
      • Reduced vulnerability to global shocks  
      • Huge employment generation  
      • Incentives for local industries to scale  

      SISEBI makes it easy to discover products where India has the strongest potential to build local capacity.
